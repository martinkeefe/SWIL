        text: `It's 1832 in West Yorkshire, England -- the cradle of the evolving Industrial 
               Revolution -- where landowner Anne Lister is determined to save her faded ancestral 
               home, Shibden Hall, even if it means bucking society's expectations. In addition to 
               reopening the coal mines, a part of Lister's plan to help her family is to marry 
               well. But the charismatic, single-minded Lister -- who dresses head-to-toe in black 
               and charms her way into high society -- has no intention of marrying a man. 
               "Gentleman Jack" examines Lister's relationships with her family, servants, tenants 
               and industrial rivals, and would-be wife. The real-life Anne Lister's story was 
               recorded in her diaries, and the most intimate details of her life are revealed for 
               the series.`,
